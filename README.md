# ML-PySpark-California-Housing
In this notebook, I have done big data processing, analysis and ML with PySpark. Firstly, I have explored and preprocessed the dataset that I loaded in at the first step the help of DataFrames. About the dataset: It appeared in a 1997 paper titled Sparse Spatial Autoregressions, written by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry and published in the Statistics and Probability Letters journal. The researchers built this data set by using the 1990 California census data.
